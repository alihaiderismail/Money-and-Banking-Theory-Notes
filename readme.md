# Course Assignment

Students are meant to make edits to the LyX file and use Git for version control to track the changes they've made and prevent conflict with other students. 

## Useful links
* [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
	+ See [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
	+ In particular focus on "Set your username in Git" and "Set your commit email address in Git"
* [Getting Started with Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)
	+ Follow Part 1: Configuring your Github account
	* Review Part 2: Using Github's tools and processes
* [Download the LyX document processor](https://www.lyx.org/)
* [How to use Lyx](https://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/Tutorials)
	+ You should navigate to Tools->Preferences->Identity and put in your name and email
* [Set up Lyx to use Git](https://www.lyx.org/HowToUseGIT)
	+ This essentially boils down to using the File->Version Control menu in LyX which makes interacting with Git very easy.

## Workflow 

The workflow should look like
1. **Before editing files:** Open Git Bash to the folder and run `git pull` to get the most up-to-date notes.
2. Edit the Lyx file(s)
3. Click on File->Version Control->Check in Changes
	a. If prompted "save your changes"
4. You will be prompted with "LyX VC: Log Message". Fill in a short 50 character description of what you did. Then click Ok.
5. In Git Bash, type `git push` to send your changes back to Github
